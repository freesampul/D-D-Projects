# D-D-Projects

Every project covered in the honors design and data structures course.

From working with new data structures to simple neural nets, these projects were covered in class.


This course was focus on datastructures and their runtimes, computing everything ourselves and recreating datastructures with Java.

We are now done with the class 😮‍💨
